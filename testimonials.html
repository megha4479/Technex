    <div class="box small">As someone who has given as well as taken a lot of interviews, I can say GreatFrontEnd is a f'king goldmine. I would highly recommend GreatFrontEnd to anyone who is preparing for front end interviews or anyone who just wants to learn some new concepts. The content is well-organized, has some great practical coding challenges, and the system design part is just amazing!!!

    <div class="box medium">Finally some good news on my side. I got a frontend engineer role at GitLab. It's been a pretty wild ride. I initially got to the final stage with one team and didn't get the job. But the recruiter matched me to another team and it worked. I'm so glad to be focusing on front-end again, not fullstack. 34% rise in base salary. Total comp is about a 52% increase, mainly because I'm leaving a Canadian startup. GFE was so helpful in building my confidence in solving frontend problems. And the community has been amazing. You all are doing the lord's work. </div>
    <div class="box large">GreatFrontEnd is the best investment you can make if you are going through a frontend interview process. There are a bunch of different prepping resources for backend roles in the market, but surprisingly, the selection for frontend material is not that great. The frontend coding exercises cover everything you could think of. The best part is that each of them has an editorial/solution section that explains step by step how to tackle the problem and multiple approaches solutions you could take; opposed to other products where you can only find solutions written by random people. Where GFE really shines is on the frontend system design section, even after being 10 years in big tech Iâ€™ve never came across such diverse and comprehensive material. I would even recommend GFE to people just trying to become better frontend engineers just for the system design section alone.

    <div class="box very-large">In today's extremely competitive and challenging job market, GreatFrontEnd was key to my success in frontend interviews, which led to me landing 4 senior level job offers, all at large tech companies. The system design content on the site is in my opinion better than any other system design content available online for frontend. Prior to joining GFE, I had no structure to my frontend system design interviews, but after going through the material and following their recommended framework, I passed every single one of my system design rounds. GFE covers frontend knowledge as well as frontend coding very well, their questions appeared in several of my interview loops which helped me not only be fully prepared for all of my interviews, but helped me excel in them. For frontend developers looking to stand out in today's job market via interview performance, GreatFrontEnd is a must have.

    <div class="box medium">I have received "Strong Hire - P50" recommendation from Atlassian hiring committee. I was asked if I want to level up for P60 on condition that I pass two more interviews - one more for system design and another for leadership crafts. I have opted in since I have nothing to lose. Thanks to GreatFrontEnd for all the system design resources.

I wish GreatFrontEnd existed earlier in my career when I was preparing for interviews. It has made the process of interview preparation significantly less painful and more efficient. The platform is a game-changer for anyone seeking to enhance their frontend development skills and succeed in interviews.</div>
    <div class="box small">GreatFrontEnd's product and community were crucial to my success in finding a new job after being laid off. GFE gave me guardrails around how I should focus my studying, I learned so much that I'll use in my career, not just for interviews. With their help, I achieved a 17% increase in base pay and 46% increase in total compensation at Cloudflare! Thank the universe for GreatFrontEnd!

    <div class="box large">Hi everyone, I got one offer from a big tech company (non-FAANG) and in parts thanks to the resources on GreatFrontEnd. I wish I had learned about this product way before so I had not bombed so many interviews. One fun story to share: I got a job offer for an IC2 role (mid-level) but the salary was low for my needs, so I requested the option to be leveled at IC3 (Senior) and they accepted to make an extra interview, everything happened very quickly, in a couple of days, so I didn't have time to ask what was the interview about so I could prepare. It ended up being a system-design interview, I had 45 mins to build Google Photos (albums and sharing). Thank God, I had reviewed some cases in GFE not long ago, especially the News Feed, which allowed me to completely ace the interview and be leveled as IC3!.

    <div class="box very-large">Just signed an offer for a Frontend Technical Lead Role at HubSpot, I would not have passed the system design + coding interviews without the @GreatFrontEnd. I was motivated to buy the subscription since I failed the Uber system design last year and definitely noticed the improvement - all system designs were pass. Overall the raw JS problems + system design ones helped with all the interview questions across the board, if I didn't prep with GFE - don't think I would have got the offer for sure. So thank you! + all the help from the community for insights.

    Happy Friday! I'm extremely fortunate to be choosing between Senior Frontend Engineer offers at a couple companies (one big non-FAANG, one startup). I just wanted to share how much help the GFE System Design and Behavioral guides were for me to prepare properly and secure my job offers! Even with the rejections I got earlier this year, I was able to take feedback, compare my behaviors to the GFE guides and see where I could improve. Thanks so much for building this resource! I'll 1000% recommend it to other FEEs looking to get a job!</div>
